# Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease using GFNet on ADNI Brain MRI Dataset
## Introduction

### Problem Description

Alzheimer’s disease is a common form of dementia that affects memory, thinking skills, and the ability to complete daily tasks. Alzheimer’s causes progressive brain atrophy, which becomes visible as shrinkage of the hippocampus and cortex, and enlargement of the ventricles. As such, deep learning models can be employed to learn to detect such changes in the structure of the brain, supporting early screening so that patients can receive early treatment and better outcomes. The purpose of this project is to train and use a Global Filter Network (GFNet) Model to classify brain MRI slices as either having Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or being Cognitively Normal (CN). The GFNet Model will be compared against a simple baseline model to evaluate whether its added complexity and computational cost provide a meaningful improvement in classification performance. The model will be trained on the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset, which contains T1-weighted structural brain MRI scans from AD and CN subjects.

### Algorithm Description

GFNet [[1]](#ref1) is a vision-transformer style architecture that replaces the self-attention sub-layer with a global filter layer. Each 224x224 input image is split into 16x16 patches, giving a 14x14 grid of 196 tokens. Each patch is linearly embedded into a 256-dimensional token, and a learnable positional embedding is added. The tokens then pass through a stack of 12 GFNet Blocks. Each of these blocks applies layer normalisation, the global filter layer, a second layer normalisation, and a feed-forward MLP, with a single residual connection around the whole block, as per the official implementation [[2]](#ref2).

The global filter layer consists of three main operations:

1. A 2D discrete Fourier Transform to convert the input features to the frequency domain.
2. An element-wise multiplication between the frequency domain features and the global filters.
3. A 2D inverse Fourier transform to convert the features back to the spatial domain.

This is equivalent to a circular convolution with a kernel as large as the whole token grid, so every region of the brain can influence every other region in a single layer. It does this at O(L log L) cost in the number of tokens L, compared with O(L²) for self-attention.

After the final block, a layer normalisation is applied, the tokens are averaged (global average pooling), and a linear classification head outputs the AD/CN prediction. The network is trained with cross-entropy loss.

## Feasibility Review

**Intended user:** Radiologists and other medical professionals who review T1-weighted brain MRIs for Alzheimer’s disease. The prototype is an assistant for diagnosis, and not a replacement. It handles high-confidence AD/CN cases and forwards ambiguous, low-confidence cases to a specialist for review.

**Scope:** Binary AD vs CN classification from the 20 pre-processed 2D slices per patient in the ADNI dataset. GFNet is compared against a simple CNN baseline on identical training/validation/test splits. Performance is reported at both the slice and patient level.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **Accuracy:** GFNet must achieve >=80% slice-level accuracy on the test set.
- **Quantitative metrics:** Per-class precision and recall, macro-F1 and AUROC must be reported. AD recall has the highest priority because missed AD cases have the most severe consequences.
- **Confidence:** A confidence threshold will be chosen on the validation set such that cases above it are automated, and cases below are forwarded to a specialist for review.
- **Resources:** Peak VRAM <= 8GB, parameter count <= 25M. Inference latency per patient is reported for both models.

**Model Choice and Course Concepts:**

- **Model:** GFNet (Hard Difficulty)
- **Baseline:** A simple CNN with 4 blocks (Conv 3x3 -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> MaxPool 2x2), followed by global average pooling and a linear head.
- **Dataset:** ADNI brain MRI dataset

**Preliminary results:**

A data audit was conducted to understand the properties of the dataset, and to verify that the train, validation, and test splits are separated at the patient level with no leakage.

```text

test   AD        4460       223
test   NC        4540       227

== Image properties (sample of 200) ==

== Leakage checks ==

patients in both AD and NC (test): 0

== Slices per patient ==
train  AD    min=20 max=20 most common=[(20, 520)]
train  NC    min=20 max=20 most common=[(20, 556)]
test   AD    min=20 max=20 most common=[(20, 223)]
test   NC    min=20 max=20 most common=[(20, 227)]

== Validation split (patients) ==
train AD=442 NC=473 total=915 AD share=0.48
val   AD=78 NC=83 total=161 AD share=0.48
test  AD=223 NC=227 total=450 AD share=0.50

Saved patient lists to splits/val_split.json
```

The dataset is roughly balanced, with AD patients making up 48-50% of total patients across all splits. Every patient has exactly 20 slices. Leakage checks confirm that no patient ID appears in more than one split or in both classes. The image have uniform size and intensity range, so preprocessing only requires resizing (cropping) and normalisation.

**Risks:**

- **Overfitting:** GFNet can memorise the training set instead of learning patterns. This can be mitigated using data augmentation, and a stronger model.
- **Asymmetric error cost:** A false negative is far more costly than a false positive. To mitigate this, AD recall must be prioritised when selecting an operating threshold.
- **Hidden leakage:** The leakage check above only checks patient IDs. If one patient has more than one ID, their scans can appear in both training and test sets, which cannot be detected.

**Budget:** A single A100 GPU on Rangpur. The main constraint is queue wait times and GPU availability.

**Next planned experiment:** Train both models with data augmentation, and measure performance on the test set.

**Fallbacks:**

- **Overfitting:** Can reduce depth or embedding dimension, increase stochastic depth, strengthen augmentation.
- **Underfitting:** Can increase depth or embedding dimension, or train for more epochs.
- **Patient-level aggregation:** Can average predictions across each patient’s 20 slices to smooth out noisy individual slices.

### Training

To train the GFNet model on the ADNI dataset, run the following command from the project directory:

```bash
python train.py --model gfnet
```

The script trains the model on a patient-level training split, as outlined in the Data Preprocessing and Training section below. The script evaluates the model on the validation split after each epoch, and saves the checkpoint with the lowest validation loss to `runs/`. An abbreviated log from the final training run is shown below (* indicates that a checkpoint was saved):

### Inference

Once trained, the model can be evaluated on the test set using the following command:

```bash
python predict.py
```

This loads the saved checkpoint, runs inference on every test slice, and prints a summary of slice-level and patient-level performance. The inputs to the model are the test images from the ADNI dataset, preprocessed as per the Data Preprocessing and Training section below. An example of the output is shown below:

### Visualisation

To better understand what GFNet learns, the learned filters of all 12 blocks were visualised in the frequency domain, and the spatial domain. Each panel is scaled independently, so the colours show each filter’s shape rather than strength.

![GFNet learned filters](images/gfnet_filters.png)

The filters appear to show a high degree of noise: with a lack of structure in both the spatial and frequency domains. This will be further discussed later in this report.



## Data Preprocessing and Training

### Dataset Structure

The ADNI dataset was stored on the Rangpur HPC cluster, and had the following folder structure:

```text
/home/groups/comp3710/
└── ADNI/
    └── AD_NC/
        ├── train/
        │   ├── AD/    10,400 slices (520 patients)
        │   └── NC/    11,120 slices (556 patients)
        └── test/
            ├── AD/     4,460 slices (223 patients)
            └── NC/     4,540 slices (227 patients)
```

### Data Preprocessing

In the initial data audit, a patient-level validation split, consisting of 15% of the training patients, was created. This split was saved to `splits/val_split.json`. Additionally, the pixel mean and standard deviation were computed from the training patients only. To preprocess the data, each 256 × 240 greyscale slice was centre-cropped to 224 × 224 (as per the official implementation [[2]](#ref2)), scaled to [0, 1], and normalised using the pixel mean (0.142) and standard deviation (0.242). No data augmentation was used initially.

### Model Definition

Firstly, the two models (GFNet and baseline CNN) were defined in `modules.py`.

The implementation of GFNet follows the GFNet-Ti configuration of Rao et al. [1] (patch size 16, embedding dimension 256, depth 12, MLP ratio 4, 224 × 224 input), adapted to a 1-channel greyscale input and a 2-class head that outputs logits for NC and AD, with reference to the official code [2].

The baseline CNN model was defined as follows:

- 4 Convolutional blocks, each: 3x3 convolution (no bias) -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> 2x2 max-pool
- Channel widths: 32->64->128->256, which reduces the 224x224 input to a 14x14 feature map.
- Global average pooling -> dropout (0.3) -> linear layer giving 2 logits (NC, AD).

### Training

Both models were trained using the same script (`train.py`), on the same data, patient-level splits, and preprocessing. Key training details/parameters are listed below:

- **Loss function:** Cross-entropy on 2 logits (NC, AD), with no label smoothing
- **Optimiser:** AdamW, weight decay 0.05
- **Batch size:** 64 slices
- **Learning rate schedule:** Linear warm-up from ~0, then cosine decay to 0, updated every batch.
- **Precision:** Mixed precision (float16) on GPU
- **Checkpoint selection:** Epoch with the lowest validation loss

The baseline CNN was selected to have a peak learning rate of 3e-4. An initial training run showed its validation accuracy repeatedly collapsing at a higher rate, hence, it was reduced. 1 warm-up epoch was used, with a maximum of 30 epochs per training run. For the GFNet model, the maximum learning rate was 1e-4, with 5 warm-up epochs, and a maximum of 50 epochs per training run.

Several training runs were completed before arriving at the final model.

1. **Training run 1:** The first training run was completed with the standard procedures listed above. Results showed that without any data augmentation, GFNet memorised the training set within approximately 8 epochs, while validation accuracy stayed at around 0.75, demonstrating clear overfitting. Similarly, the CNN also overfit. In addition, the CNN’s validation loss and accuracy were highly unstable for the first 20 epochs, collapsing to approximately 50% accuracy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/training_curves_run_1.png" alt="Training curves, run 1" width="50%">
</p>

2. **Training run 2:** To address the overfitting that occurred in the previous run, data augmentation was introduced: rotation up to +/- 10 degrees, translation by up to 5% of the image size, and scaling between 0.95 and 1.05. Results showed that GFNet no longer memorised the training set, with the training and validation accuracies rising together. The CNN training curves remain unstable until approximately epoch 20, however, they settle at approximately a 90% validation accuracy, and a slightly lower training accuracy than before, indicating less memorisation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/training_curves_run_2.png" alt="Training curves, run 2" width="50%">
</p>

3. **Training run 3:** A third training run was completed to investigate whether changing the size of the GFNet model would impact its performance. A smaller GFNet was used, with an embedding dimension of 192, and depth of 6. This yielded very similar results to Training Run 2.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/training_curves_run_3.png" alt="Training curves, run 3" width="50%">
</p>

The GFNet and CNN from training run 2 were selected for all future analysis and evaluation. The larger GFNet was preferred to the smaller one in run 3 as it matches the official implementation.

## Investigation of the Open Research Dilemma

### Quantitative Benchmarking

Using the results from `evaluate.py`, the performance of the two models can be evaluated. The results are summarised below:

```text

Cross-entropy loss                1.157              -
```

Overall, the two models perform very similarly based on the metrics above.

- On the test set, both models have similar slice-level and patient-level accuracies, with GFNet slightly outperforming the CNN at the patient level. Note that patient level predictions were made by taking the average prediction across all slices, with a threshold of 0.5.
- The CNN has a slightly higher AUROC score (0.852 vs 0.840), suggesting that it is slightly better at separating the two classes.
- Both models have a poor patient-level sensitivity (0.583 for GFNet, 0.565 for CNN), meaning that they both miss over 40% of AD patients. This is a serious limitation for screening, because a false negative would falsely reassure a patient with AD and delay their diagnosis and care. On the other hand, the models have high patient-level specificity (0.934 and 0.938), indicating that they can effectively clear healthy patients.
- Similarly, the models have high precision for AD cases (0.894 and 0.903), meaning that an AD prediction is likely to be correct. However, the precision for NC patients is much lower (0.686 and 0.696), indicating that roughly 30% of NC predictions are actually AD.
- The GFNet has a higher cross-entropy loss (1.157 vs 0.961), indicating that GFNet is more overconfident when wrong.

To further investigate the nature of the predictions of the models, a set of histograms were plotted, which show the predicted AD probabilities for both models.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/test_slice_prob_hist.png" alt="Predicted AD probability histograms" width="80%">
</p>

The histograms confirm the low sensitivity and high specificity: NC slices lie almost entirely below 0.5, while many AD slices sit confidently near 0. So most missed AD cases are confident errors rather than borderline ones, which explains the high test loss of both models.

Overall, based on these results, the CNN is the better choice. It provides equal classification performance, with slightly better confidence. GFNet’s added complexity isn’t justified.

Clearly, the GFNet model is much more computationally expensive compared to the baseline CNN model. This further justifies why the CNN is the better option in this application.


### Qualitative Error Autopsies

In this section, three different failure cases will be analyse to better understand the performance of the GFNet model:

    17  1005735_110.jpeg    0.003          NC
    18  1005735_111.jpeg    0.011          NC

---------------------------------------------
  Mean                      0.007          NC
Slice std 0.008
```

For this patient, the model predicts all of the 20 slices as NC with very high certainty (each below 0.025). The mean prediction is 0.007, and the standard deviation is 0.008, so the model is confident and consistent.

The most likely trigger for this is that in the slices shown, the brain appears to be visually healthy, with no clear evidence of atrophy. A likely explanation for this is that this is a case of mild or early-stage Alzheimer’s, where the label is a result of clinical diagnosis and not imaging alone.

This is the most dominant failure mode, as supported by the spike near 0 in the histogram. No confidence-based rule could catch this, because the model is confident and consistent in its prediction.

#### Case 2: Patient 1011824 – conflicted miss (true AD, predicted NC)

    20   1011824_97.jpeg    0.110          NC
---------------------------------------------
  Mean                      0.462          NC
Slice std 0.413
```

In this case, the slices disagree significantly. Slices 1-2 and 8-14 are confidently AD, while slices 3-7 and 15-20 are confidently NC. The mean of 0.462 is right below the threshold, and the standard deviation is very high (0.413).

The slices show clear signs of atrophy, but neighbouring slices that look nearly identical show very different predictions. The image quality appears to be slightly grainier than the previous case, which suggests that image/scan quality can have an impact on predictions.

A slice disagreement rule would be able to catch this case in a real application, since the spread is higher than normal.

#### Case 3: Patient 1253141 – confident false alarm (true AD, predicted NC)

    15  1253141_109.jpeg    0.872          AD
    16  1253141_110.jpeg    0.885          AD
    17  1253141_111.jpeg    0.994          AD
    18  1253141_112.jpeg    0.997          AD
    19  1253141_113.jpeg    1.000          AD
    20  1253141_114.jpeg    0.999          AD
---------------------------------------------
  Mean                      0.941          AD
Slice std 0.124
```

In this case, all 20 slices were classified as AD. The mean is 0.941, and the standard deviation is moderate at 0.124. The model was confident and consistent.

The slices show that despite the patient being healthy, there are signs of atrophy. One potential explanation for this could be age-related atrophy, in an older cognitively normal person.

Similarly to Case 1, this is a confident failure case that no confidence-based rule could catch.

### Recommendations

Based on the results throughout this report, several recommendations can be made regarding model choice, using the model in practice, and steps to be taken before deployment:

1. If a patient’s mean AD probability is at least 0.9, they should be reported as AD and should be fast-tracked to a specialist. This is justified by the fact that 0.9 is well above the threshold of 0.9. Additionally, the histograms above show that most correct AD slices sit above 0.9, with very few NC slices reaching this level. This does not clear any patient below 0.9, as it has clearly been shown that the model is frequently overconfident that an AD patient is healthy (e.g. failure case 1).
2. Even if a patient has a mean AD probability of at least 0.9, if their slice probabilities have a standard deviation of 0.2 or more, they should be forwarded to a specialist for review. This is because a high mean can hide conflicting slices, meaning that the model’s predictions are inconsistent. This rule highlights cases where the model’s predictions are inconsistent, ensuring that such disagreements are reviewed by a specialist.
3. The CNN is the better model for this application. Both models have a very similar classification performance, and similar failure modes. However, the GFNet is much more computationally expensive and complex. The added architectural complexity and computational cost of the GFNet is not justified by its performance.
4. Neither model is suitable or ready for autonomous use. It has been shown that both models miss over 40% of AD patients, with many of those being confident misses.
